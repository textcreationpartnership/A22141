            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wherefore let vs not breed that viper in our breaſts which will eate through our tender bowels of mercie, kindnes, long-ſufferance and forgiueneſſe.

            <p>For the Apoſtles, though in their Epiſtles to particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, none (ſaue Saint <hi>Paule</hi>) cite humanitie, yet who can ſhew that in their popular Sermons to the Gentiles throughout the whole world, they alleaged not truth out of Poets, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and Hiſtorians, ſeeing Chriſt promiſed them, that his ſpirit ſhould leade them, not onely into truth, but <hi>in omnem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem,</hi> into all truth? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 13.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Though neither did, as in ſhewing vs the immediat will of God, and laying downe the grounds of faith, it was not ſo conuenient to mixe it with mens precepts: yet in expounding this will, in explaning the ſence of words and phraſe of ſpeech, in declaring the nature of birds, beaſts, and ſtones, &amp;c. to which they allude, we cannot cut the word aright, without the vſe of Grammarians in the proprietie &amp; acceptation of words: without helpe of Logicians in diſtinguiſhing ambiguities: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ayde of Rhetoricians in following precepts and rules of ſpeech to perſwade: without helpe of Hiſtoriographers to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate times: of naturall Philoſophie, to ſcan cauſes and their effects: Geometrie, to find ſites and ſituations, and ſuch like. Wherefore though they onely ſpake immediatly from the Lord in declaring his will, yet can we not without theſe helps, expound it fully to euery mans conceipt. <hi>Moſes</hi> receiued the law from the Lord at mount Sinai: bringeth he nought elſe to expound it to Iſrael?

And how can we ſilly ones of our ſelues, open all the meanings of all theſe, ſhew the nature of things to which they allude, note the right acceptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of words which are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, find out the diſtance of places which they inſinuate, and ſuch like, without Philoſophers, Poets, Hiſtorians, who haue truly declared them at large?

Why then are any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of commenters alledged? why do we open it by our own diſcourſe, ranging one ſentence beyond the very words of the word? but onely becauſe they and we ſpeake that which conſenteth with the doctrin of faith? And why is it not as good from Philoſophers, Poets and Hiſtorians, as from our owne braine, when it ſuteth with truth of the word, and is according to the analogie of faith.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Other reaſons kept the Prophets and Apoſtles from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging Secular learning to their people, which reſtraine not vs Chriſtians.

            <p>Shall I anſwer them with the auncient Fathers on this point? No, it were in vaine: they are not aſhamed to proclaime in Athens and eare of all learning, <hi>Nos non curamus quid dicunt Patres,</hi> we care not whatſoeuer the Fathers ſay. Wherefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſtead of the Fathers they haue children, whom they make Princes in all lands, I will anſwer them with <hi>Caluin, P. Martyr, Aretius, Hemingius</hi> and <hi>Gualther</hi> on theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To begin with the chiefeſt and firſt. Here two queſtions ariſe, ſaith <hi>Caluin</hi> on this place; one, whether <hi>Paul</hi> here condemneth wholy the wiſedome of words as aduerſary to Chriſt? No, ſaith he, <hi>à ratione valdè diſſentaneum eſt,</hi> It is very diſſonant from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould condemne thoſe arts, which is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, are the excellent gifts of God, wherby as with inſtruments men are helped to good vſes. The arts, as they are not ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, but containe ſolide learning: ſo no doubt they came from the holy Ghoſt, and the profite that commeth by them muſt be aſcribed to none but the Lord. This therefore that <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaketh muſt not be taken <hi>in contumeliam artiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> to diſgrace the arts, as if they were repugnant to pietie.</q> This <hi>Caluin</hi> on the firſt queſtion, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh nought in this place againſt the arts and ſecular learning or wiſdome of words in the pulpit.</p>
            <p>A ſecond queſtion he propoſeth, <q>whether <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth there is ſo perpetuall contrarietie and iarre betweene the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell and eloquence, that they cannot ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and that the preaching of the Goſpell is contaminated, <hi>ſiquis ad eam ornandam eloquentie color adhibeatur,</hi> for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, the croſſe of Chriſt is made of none effect, if any wiſedome of words be adioyned. I anſwer (ſaith he) we muſt conſider to whom <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeake, namely to the Corinthians, whoſe eares itched with a fooliſh deſire of magniloquence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other therefore were they to be called back to the humility
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:401:141"/> of the croſſe, that they might learne to embrace nakedly Chriſt, and ſimply the Goſpell without deceipt, and therefore came he not to them in the wiſedome of words.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But what (ſaith he) if any now <hi>Paulo nitidiùs diſſerendo Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelij doctrinam eloquentia illuſtret?</hi> by preaching more elegantly then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> beautifieth the Goſpell with eloquence and wiſedome of words? is he therefore to be refuſed, as if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated it, or obſcured the glory of Chriſt? I anſwer firſt (ſaith <hi>Caluin) Eloquentiam nihil pugnare cum ſimplicitate Euangelij,</hi> that eloquence is no way againſt the ſimplicitie of the Goſpell, which without diſdaine not onely yeelds to it, but ſubiecteth it ſelfe, and like an handmaid ſerues and waites on her miſtreſſe. For as <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeaketh: He who gaue vs <hi>Peter</hi> a fiſherman, gaue vs alſo <hi>Cyprian</hi> a Rhetorician, whereby he ſignifieth that both are of God: howſoeuer the one which in dignitie was much ſuperior, was deſtitute of all grace of ſpeech: the other who ſitteth at his feet, excelled in eloquence. His concluſion is, This eloquence therefore is not to be condemned nor aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, which aymeth not at this, to hold Chriſtians in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward colour of words, that it may inebriate their eares with vaine oblectation and delight, but that it may bring vs by perſwaſion to receiue the ſimplicitie of the Goſpell: <hi>Vt denique tanquam praeconis officio fungatur, ad comparandam piſcatoribus il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis &amp; idiot is audientiam:</hi> That like a Cryer it may get thoſe Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots and fiſhermen audience, <hi>qui nihil praeter ſpiritus energiam gratiae habent,</hi> who haue no grace of ſpeech to perſwade, but onely the power and efficacie of the ſpirit.</q> The ſumme of his anſwer is, that this place is no cloake for the rude and illiterate preaching of any, ſeeing <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeakes nought here againſt the vſe of good arts in Sermons, as if they were repugnant to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. 2. That he ſpake but this to taxe the itching eares of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths, who thirſted after nought but eloquence in their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: for which cauſe he preached to them onely in ſimplicitie of words to bring them backe from that humor. 3. That a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may lawfully, yea muſt neceſſarily <hi>nitidiùs Paulo diſſerere,</hi> preach more eloquently then <hi>Paule,</hi> that his eloquence like a cryer or perſwader, may allure auditors to the ſimplicitie of the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:401:142"/> Goſpell, and get audience to thoſe fiſhermen and idiots, who haue no grace of perſwading, but from the efficacie of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. What ſhould I cite the reſt, <hi>Plato eſt inſtar omnium</hi> to theſe men. <hi>Hemingius</hi> on this place iumpeth with <hi>Caluins</hi> expoſition, reſoluing, that a Preacher may adorne and beautifie the Goſpel, <hi>nitidiori ſermone Paulo,</hi> with more enticing ſpeech of mans wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, with wiſedome of words, and a more poliſhed ſtile then Saint <hi>Paules. Licet quidem omni eloquentiae gratia illuſtrare Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium:</hi> It is lawfull (ſaith he) to illuſtrate and garniſh the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell with al grace of eloquence, ſo that men be not made drunk with vaine delight of words. And in fine he aduiſeth vs in what part of our Sermon we ſhould vſe it, <hi>praeſtat,</hi> it is beſt to vſe plainneſſe and ſimplicitie in teaching, grandiloquence and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence in exhorting and confuting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> agreeing with both their expoſitions, giues two good leſſons, one to learned Preachers, that although in preaching the Goſpell they be decked with theſe good arts, yet they truſt not in them. Another to illiterate and rude ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers: <hi>Neque praetextu ſermonis impolitioris diuinarum Scriptura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum committere debent Eccleſiaſtici homines, vt de induſtria putide loquantur.</hi> Miniſters and Eccleſiaſticall men muſt not of purpoſe ſpeake rudely vnder this pretence, that the Scriptures ſtile is not ſo eloquent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gualther</hi> is of the ſame iudgement on this place, and <hi>Aretius</hi> in his cited Problemes anſwereth this place ſo largely, that I cannot cite him.</p>
            <p>The reaſons why the Apoſtles vſed not, nor needed elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and why for vs it is more neceſſarie, are theſe out of <hi>P. Martyr.</hi> Firſt, perfect Rhetoricke was ſo rare a thing, (as <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> preſcribed an Orator, that none could attaine,) that Chriſt at firſt publiſhing of his Goſpell choſe not ſo rare, hard and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a meanes, becauſe he had need of many who could not eaſily be found, and when afterward they came, he refuſed them not, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi>

            <p n="2">2 It had bene ſuſpitious, to haue perſwaded this new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (as it ſeemed) by wiſedome of words, enticing ſpeech of Orators, Philoſophers, Poets, and coloured eloquence, leſt

            <p>For the firſt. That learning which the Scriptures forbid not to be vſed in popular Sermons, may be lawfully vſed therein, 1. <hi>Cor. 6. 12.

And though ſome of them when they knew God, glorified him not as God, but became vaine in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and turned the glorie of the incorruptible God into the ſimilitude of an image of a corruptible man, and of birds, of foure footed beaſts, and creeping things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 23.

            <p>For the third precept, forbidding <hi>to take Gods name in vaine,</hi> manie of them by this their knowledge deteſted Exorciſmes wherein it was prophaned, and <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> in <hi>Plutarke</hi> chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Pericles</hi> for this thing.

            <p>For the fourth precept, of <hi>keeping his Sabboth,</hi> they ordained lawes for the like, though abuſing their knowledge, they miſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it with multitude of ceremonies and ridiculous rites.</p>
            <p>Touching the ſecond table in generall, their precept of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie was, Do to others as ye would be done to, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaith is the Law and the Prophets.</p>
            <p>For the firſt precept, of <hi>honouring our parents, Homer</hi> bad the ſame, and gaue the ſame motiue, <hi>That thou maiſt liue long vpon earth.</hi> And <hi>Solon</hi> (as <hi>Tully</hi> reporteth) made no law againſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricides, becauſe he thought none would be ſo vnnaturall and vngodly, as to kill his parents.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> their reuealed law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall knowledge taught them this abundantly, prohibiting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide by their publike lawes, as their bookes witneſſe. And ſuch was their ſeueritie againſt it, that from the building of the Citie, the ſpace of 620. yeares none was killed by anie priuate hand within the wals, as <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus</hi> reporteth.</p>
            <p>For the third, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adulterie,</hi> their lawes were ſeuere againſt it, and puniſhments of it grieuous. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians lawes puniſhed it with a thouſand ſtripes in the man, and cut off the noſe of the woman, to deterre others from the like, <hi>Diod.

            <p>The <hi>Leprei</hi> led the men three dayes through the Citie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning them all their life after, and made the women ſtand vp in the market place to be a ſpectacle of ſhame eleuen daies, <hi>Cael.

            <p>The Cretans mulct it largely, and excluding adulterers from all office and dignitie, crowned it with ignominie. <hi>Aelian. var. hiſt. lib. 12. &amp; Cael. lib. 21. cap.</hi> 45.</p>
            <p>The Arabians puniſhed it with death, <hi>Alex. ab Alex. lib. 4. cap.</hi> 1. and Parthians no ſinne more ſeuerely.

            <p>The Scythians puniſhed no fault ſorer. The Indians iudged it the greateſt. The Atrians ſtoned it. The Phrygians if one ſtole but an inſtrument of husbandrie, made it death, <hi>Stob. ſer. 42. Alex. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 5. and the lawes of the twelue Tables in Rome, puniſhed night-theft with death, <hi>Gel. lib. 11. cap. 18. Alex. lib. 6. cap.</hi> 10.</p>

            <p>For the ſixt and laſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt not couet,</hi> the bookes of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, Poets, and Hiſtorians are full <hi>de fraenandis affectibus,</hi> to ſpeake nothing of their lawes.

Go ye to the Iles of Chittim and behold; ſend vnto Kedar and take diligent heede, and ſee whether there be ſuch things: hath any nation changed their gods as my people? So did the Prophets: <hi>Eſai</hi> prouoked the vnthankfull Iewes to gratitude by the example of the Oxe and the Aſſe. <hi>Ieremie</hi> the ſecure Iewes to oportunitie by the examples of the Swallow, Turtle and Crane. <hi>Salomon</hi> the ſlouthfull to labour, by the example of the Emmet. Our Sauiour did the like, when he commended the Centurions faith, <hi>Math.</hi> 8. to taxe the perfidious and vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Iewes: by the Niniuites example he vrged the negligent Iewes to repentance. By the Lepers returne inuited he them to thankfulneſſe: by that iourney of the Queene of the South: that reading of the Eunuch: that almes of <hi>Cornelius:</hi> and that hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talititie of the widdow of Sarepta, laboured he to prouoke the Iewes for ſhame to follow them. And though ſome may obiect theſe were cited from the old Teſtament, yet alleaged he not in the new all the heathens, when he pricked forward his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers with this ſpurre, <hi>Nonne &amp; Ethnici hoc faciunt?

This is the practiſe of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his Prophets, of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and recent homiliſts in their popular ſermons, and (as he ſaid) <hi>aut hoc ſatis teſtium eſt, aut nihil eſt.</hi> Now there is one obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt all, which was put againſt me when I vrged this practiſe of all writers, and it was verbatim this, <hi>But M.

And ſeeing all truth is from God, there is no doubt but the Lord put into the mouth euen of the wicked, whatſoeuer things containe true and wholeſome doctrine. But the handling of this matter I would rather to be taken out of <hi>Baſils</hi> oration to his nephewes. Who could haue ſaid more matter in fewer words for the vſe of ſecular learning in ſermons? And leaſt any ſhould think he thought ſo but once, and afterward changed his opinion, he ſecondeth it againe, <hi>comment. in Tit.</hi> 1. 12. where ſpeaking of <hi>Pauls</hi> citing <hi>Epimenides</hi>

Deinde quu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> omnia Dei ſint, cur fas non eſſet in eius gloriam applicare quicquid in eum vſum aptè conferri poteſt? ſed de hac re legatur Baſilij oratio ad iuuenes.</hi> We gather from this place (ſaith <hi>Caluin</hi>) that they are ſuperſtitious who dare borow nothing of prophane writers. For ſeeing all truth is of God, if any thing be well and truly ſpoken of the wicked, it ought not to be refuſed becauſe it came from God. Againe, ſeeing al things belong to God, why ſhould it not be lawfull to vſe and apply to his glorie whatſoeuer may fitly be beſtowed to that vſe? but for this point reade <hi>Baſils</hi> ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his nephewes. <hi>Caluins</hi> iudgement (we plainely ſee) is, that Preachers may cite any truth from all heathen authors though neuer ſo wicked. His reaſon is, becauſe it came to them from God, who put into their mouth things containing true and wholeſome doctrine. If true, then to be vſed in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: if wholeſome in exhortation. And for reproofe of our Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, he calleth them <hi>ſuperstitious</hi> men, that ſtand too much on points, who dare not vſe it, nay that it ought not to be refuſed, ſith it came from God, and belongeth vnto him, but muſt be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to his glorie. Wherefore (to conclude all) ſeeing the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture forbids not ſecular learning in popular ſermons, as in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of their obiected places I haue ſhewed; ſeeing God himſelfe preached it to the people for the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. ſeeing the knowledge thereof taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to do the things of the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. Seeing the Apoſtle forbids onely the vaine deceit of it to the people. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saint <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth vs to trie all things in any author, and keepe that which is good, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. Seeing Preachers in things not forbidden muſt be all to all, to Iewes in the law as Iewes, to Gentiles without law as Gentiles, that they may winne the mo, &amp; by al meanes ſaue ſome, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. Seeing they muſt deuide the word aright to their people, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. which without this knife they cannot do, but pull it aſunder and teare it with their teeth; Seeing the heathens doctrine which is true, is taken out of the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:401:183"/> ſcriptures: ſith truth remaineth ſtil truth whereſoeuer we find it. Seeing we thinke it fit to ſeaſon our children and new veſſels for their knowledge and good manners. Seeing for the vſe of it, we ſtudy it many yeares, furniſh our ſtudies with profane authors, ſtay in the Vniuerſities, and frequent libraries. Seeing laſtly the auncient Fathers and preciſeſt late-writers haue thought and iudged it lawfull, and much vſed it themſelues when they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to their people: at leaſt, ſeeing <hi>Caluin</hi> thinks ſo, this might perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they were not of a priuat ſpirit, that ſecular lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (yea much of it) is not only not vnlawful, but alſo neceſſary in popular ſermons.
